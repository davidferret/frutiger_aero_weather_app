# Frutiger Aero Weather App 

This project was good practice for JavaScript and CSS. It uses the free and open-source Open-Meteo API. It is inspired by the Frutiger Aero design style, which I loved as a child growing up. With this app, you can quickly check the weather and see details like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and conditions of countless cities worldwide.
